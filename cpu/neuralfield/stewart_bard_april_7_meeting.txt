Notes:

Change in frequency, higher frequency at bifurfcation.

Evidence of partial propagation. Amplitude attenuation as a function of distance from electrode during passive stim state (we have it maybe for the
movement state). 

Single example, cherry picked! 

1: it is a hopf (because data)
2: it can't be the other 2 SNIC, Saddle-node
3: how do we get excitatbility in a hopf?
4: this is how: put the system close to bifurcation and make nullclines excitable / close together (what parameter regime is needed)
5: problem: waves propagate indefinitely
-- Is this consistent with the data? 
-- -- Re-entrant waves never observed after stim removal
-- -- Immedediate end of gamma power within one cycle
-- -- Amplitude attenuation further from stim site
6: Infinite propagation seemingly inconsistnat with data?
-- Makes sense, because cortex had mechanism to avoid spurious high-rate / wave activity (don't want a seizure)
7: Can we fix the model?
-- yes, and here is the parameter regime
-- Here is how you prove the region of paramemeter that give finite propagation
8: How realistic is it?
-- It seems pretty fine-tuned, what are the implications?
-- Does the brain self tune?
-- Model is VERY simplified, in reality MANY E and I cell types
-- Discuss: could there be fast-timescale network homeostatic mechanism:
-- -- inbuilt circuity to  maintain function even though
-- -- -- rates are perturbed
-- -- -- oscillations emerge
-- Open question: simple reduce E-I model is fine tuned, 
-- -- Are more complex ("accurate") models easier to tune? 
9: Predictions of model for future experiments.
-- Fine tuning? (can we collapse parameter space down to 1 or 2 bifurcation parameters and dicuss how these are tuned?)

Then: discuss how this related robustness and homeostasis
